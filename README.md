NEXST stand for *Next Environment for [XiangShan](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/XiangShan) Target*. This system serves as an FPGA prototyping and accelerated emulation environment for processor system level test.
The environment has been successfully ported to a local desktop setup, allowing access to the PCIe add in cards via Thunderbolt.
# Project Overview
This project comprises two main parts:
- The NEXST code and the dependency [XDMA drivers](https://gitlab.agileserve.org.cn:8001/serve\_hw\_sw\_dev/dma\_ip\_drivers).
- The first version of the expansion enclosure prototype.
